# Franz Recipe for Life360 Services

This is the recipe to use Life 360 on Franz

Life360 is a friends & family networking app released in 2008. It is a location-based service designed primarily to allow friends or family members to share location with each other. Even the free account allows one to use a broad range of services.

Franz is a free messaging app that combines chat & messaging services into one applicationm and much more. I use Franz for WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Google Calendar, Gmail and Remember the Milk and... Life360. It keeps my desktop neat and organized.

To use this recipe put the files of Life360 folder in the dev folder of Franz. In windows it is usually on
\Users\(user name)\AppData\Roaming\Franz\recipes\dev
You can check the correct folder after you install Franz: go do "add service", then choose "custom services". You can see the folder location as well as open the folder directly to copy the files.

Hope it helps!
Cheers from Brazil!
